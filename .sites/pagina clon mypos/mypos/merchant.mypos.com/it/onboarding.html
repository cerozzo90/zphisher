With other members of myPOS or iCard AD\u2019s corporate family:&lt;\/strong&gt; We may share your Personal Data with members of the myPOS or iCard Group of companies or within our extended family of companies that are related by common ownership or control, so that we may organise, manage and facilitate the Campaigns or Promotional Events for which you applied or in which you participated, or to manage the risk, or to help detect and prevent potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.2. With our partners and distributors:&lt;\/strong&gt; We may share information related to you or your company with our partners and distributors, if we are carrying out a joint Campaign or Promotional Event or if they are helping us organise, manage and facilitate a Campaigns or Promotional Events. In such cases, our partners and distributors may process some of your personal information.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.3.

This does not mean that we will always use automated decision making for these processing activities. In case you believe that you have been unfairly treated by our automated decision-making systems you may, at any time, ask that a person reviews the decision by contacting us as described in the \u201cHow do I complain?\u201d section. Such decisions may be done for processing activities that include:&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;table class=&quot;rates&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;tr&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;th&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing activity&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;\/th&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;th&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated processing logic&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;\/th&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;tr&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;td&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;Detect and prevent fraud, abuse, security incidents, and other harmful activity by blocking users and participants or by applying other fraud prevention measures.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;td&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;Our fraud-prevention and monitoring systems may sometimes take automated decisions in regard to suspicious behaviour. For example, we may block a certain transaction or access to online service due to an attempt made in a remote part of the world just a few minutes after your last login from your home country.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;tr&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;td&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;Evaluation of metrics in relation to a Campaign or Promotional Event.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;td&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;Our monitoring and analysis systems may sometimes take automated decisions in regard to evaluation of metrics related to Campaigns or Promotional Events. For example, the evaluation of the answers to multiple choice questions from a quiz may be reviewed and the result may be evaluated through an automated system.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;\/tbody&gt;\r\n\t&lt;\/table&gt;\r\n\t\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VI.

Withdrawing consent and restriction of processing.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by us you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting the relevant Data Controller via email and specifying which consent you are withdrawing. In case the Campaign or Promotional Event is carried our online and you have an Account you may withdraw your consent by updating the settings in your Account. Please note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular if: (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information; (iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to the processing and pending the verification whether our legitimate grounds override your own.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.5. Objection to processing.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to require us not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling for marketing purposes) where such processing is based on legitimate interest. If you object to such processing we will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing, or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you may, at any time ask us to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes by sending an email to the contact emails below.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.6. Opting out.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;You can ask us to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting the relevant Data Controller.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;Please bear in mind that irrespective of your opt-out, related to marketing messages, you will still continue to receive specific messages, which we are required to send you under the applicable legislation, insofar as you still have a legal relationship with us.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.7.
